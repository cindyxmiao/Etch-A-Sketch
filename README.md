# etchASketch

A sketching game where the user can paint on a grid canvas by dragging the mouse across its squares. 
In addition, there is a button that changes the size of the grid (1-100) by prompting for user input.

Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of javascript, specifically, adding event listeners and
manipulation of HTML through Javascript.
